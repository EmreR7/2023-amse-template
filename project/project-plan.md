# Project Plan

## Summary

This project will use 2 data sets to explore the impact of fuel price on commute behavior in order to answer
how changes in fuel prices affect the use of means for commuting, such as driving. Are there specific 
fuel price thresholds that lead to changes in commute behavior? Do commute patterns differ between regions
of Germany with different fuel prices or traffic conditions? In particular, the last 3 years are observed 
in which the fuel prices have risen sharply.

## Rationale

By combining and analyzing these datasets, it is possible gain insights into how fuel prices impact 
commute behavior in Germany.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: Tankerkönig

* Data Type: CSV

Commute Traffic Data in Germany: The German Federal Highway Research Institute (Bundesanstalt für Straßenwesen, or BASt) provides a dataset with traffic data for major highways in Germany. The dataset includes information on traffic volume, speed, and congestion levels for different time periods throughout the day. This dataset can be used to analyze the impact of fuel prices on commute traffic.
